# Overview

ImJoy is a flexible image processing framework allowing the deployment of complex
computational tasks in a robust, secure and easy-to-use environment. The entire functionality is provided by **plugins**. Within a modern graphical user-interface, these plugins can be assembled into **workflows**. This design makes ImJoy intuitive to work with for end users.

Imjoy consists of **two parts**:
1. the **user interface**
2. the **computational backend**
